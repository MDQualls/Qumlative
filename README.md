# Qumlative

This is very much an older application I worked on that included quite a bit of experimentation with NodeJs, ExpressJs, and MongooseJs.
The client side was made up of AngularJs 1.X and I used Less for the CSS generation.

I actually launched this application for a short time on a free service just to see it run and play with it, but it was never 
what I would consider a production application.
