                        Recently, most of my time at work is spent on DevOps tasks ...

                        I attend meetings, build work breakdown structures, manage projects, put together documentation, manage repositories & rollouts, etc ... 
                        I pretty much do everything except what I most enjoy doing: coding.  It seems that this is the natural career progression for a guy in his mid-40's that was around when the Internet first exploded.

                        So, I decided to start building more things on my own.  To scratch that itch.  I also decided to throw up this site to document the things I work on.                                                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will probably (most likely) throw in some editorials from time to time and discuss some of the causes I support.  
                        But, mostly, this is the dumping ground for the results of my tinkering, research and experimentation.

                            In general, I am a programming technology enthusiast.                              
                            Even though the majority of my professional work is with the .NET stack, 
                            I enjoy open source and that is where I work in my spare time.
                            Javascript is probably my favorite language, but my job is mostly about C#.
